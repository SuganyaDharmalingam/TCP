*****************Evaluation of TCP throughput performance in Wireless Mesh Network************************

The project is based on the implementation of Wireless Mesh Network using 802.11s protocol along with TCP agents CUBIC and New Reno. 

The implemented Cubic and New Reno Algorithm are verified with the simulator and the resulted throughput is compared and validated. 

The Results of Cubic over wireless Mesh Network outperforms New Reno.

It requires NS-3 simulator.
